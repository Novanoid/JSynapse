An implementation of artificial neural networks and the error backpropagation algorithm for training


Contains the framework for a neural network, the error backpropagation algorithm and specific training classes for handwritten digit recognition and cat recognition. Trained networks can be saved and loaded, a trained and saved digit recognition network is included.

New trainings for other tasks can be implemented by inheriting from the Training super class.
